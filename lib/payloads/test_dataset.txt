INTRODUCTION
The politics of language and the language of politics are deeply intertwined, particularly in post-colonial contexts where language serves as both a tool of power and a site of resistance. Language is not merely a means of communication; it is a carrier of culture, identity, and ideology. Throughout history, dominant groups, especially colonial powers, have imposed their languages on subjugated populations, using language as a tool of control. The politics of language examines how the choice of language influences social hierarchies, cultural identity, and power dynamics. In contrast, the language of politics focuses on how political discourse is shaped by the language used, how it frames ideologies, and how it serves to consolidate or challenge power structures. In my assignment, I will explore these themes of language politics and the language of politics in Ngugi’s writings, analyzing how his rejection of English and his embrace of Gikuyu directly challenge the colonial power structures that sought to dominate African minds and cultures. Seen through this lens, Ngugi’s works not only stand as literary achievements but also as acts of political defiance, underscoring the profound connection between language, identity, and liberation.
Ngugi wa Thiong’o, born in 1938 in Limuru, Kenya, is one of the most prominent African writers and intellectuals of the post-colonial era. He is an icon of anti-colonial resistance and an outspoken advocate of African literature in native African language.  His literary journey reflects the turbulent historical and political changes in Kenya, especially during and after the country’s struggle for independence. Ngugi’s early education at Alliance High School and Makerere University played a crucial role in shaping his intellectual foundations. His early novels, such as Weep Not, Child, and The River Between, reflected the tensions between traditional African values and the encroaching influence of colonialism, as well as the psychological and social impacts of colonial rule on the Kenyan people. Ngugi’s decision to shift from writing in English to his native Gikuyu marked a major turning point in his career, signaling his firm stance on the politics of language and cultural decolonization. His book Decolonising the Mind (1986) is a landmark in African literary criticism, where he argues that language is central to the control exerted by colonial powers, who used European languages to alienate Africans from their own cultures. Throughout his career, Ngugi has remained a fierce critic of both colonial and post-colonial systems of oppression, advocating for African writers to embrace indigenous languages as a form of resistance and to reclaim their cultural identities. This ideological stance is reflected in his works, such as Devil on the Cross and Matigari, which were written in Gikuyu. His commitment to social justice and his unwavering dedication to African languages and cultures have cemented Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s place as a key figure in post-colonial literature.
Ngugi wa Thiong’o has been a staunch critic of colonial rule, Christianity and post-colonial abuses of Kenyan authorities. The rejection of hegemonic language and religion shows his tendency toward native culture and establishes him as a spokesperson of African authenticity. 
His abrogation is a rejection of a normative concept of ‘correct’ or standard English used by certain classes of groups and of the corresponding concepts of inferior ‘dialects’ or ‘marginal variants’. The commencement of his literary career was with the English language when he produced some of the best-known novels of Africa such as Weep Not, Child (1964), The River Between (1965), A Grain of Wheat (1967), Petals of Blood (1977). Later he bids farewell to 
English and announces his return to his native Gikuyu tongue in his works. His work Decolonising the Mind, focuses on the question of language. According to him, language is the medium to control the psychic space of people by colonial powers, so he is determined to help his community to return to its roots through a linguistic break. He explains the reason of his rejection of English and calls African writers to do the same. This was not supported by many African writers including Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe. But he calls the politics of language a ‘quest of relevance,’ a search for a liberating perspective. Ngugi criticizes writers 
like Okara and Achebe for advocating the Africanizing of the English language to express African experiences and surrender themselves to the hegemonic language. For Ngugi an effective post-colonial voice can only be found in the total rejection of the European languages and a “return to the roots”. He also believes that an African writer who has chosen total  dependency and literary enslavement to foreign languages will never be able to speak to national audience and will be always detached from the indigenous mass. He appeals in Decolonising the Mind that, Kenyan writers have no alternative but to return to the roots, return to the sources of their being in the rhythms of life and speech and language of the Kenyan masses if they are to rise to the great challenge of recreating, in their poems, plays and novels, the epic grandeur of that history. The language question symbolizes the struggle of African writers and artists to free themselves from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism not only politically but also culturally and psychologically. Ngugi writes, “I believe that my writing in Gikuyu language, a Kenyan language, an African language, is part and parcel of the anti-imperialist struggles of Kenyan and African peoples”.
The process of decolonization is a political and cultural assertion in which the colonized refuses to articulate the oppressor’s language and looks back to own language. Ngugi argues that colonialism involved two aspects : the destruction or the deliberate undervaluing of a people’s culture, their art, dances, religions, history, geography, education, orature and literature and the conscious elevation of the language of the coloniser”.  In  ‘The Language of African Literature’ Ngugi discusses that language is the carrier of culture and use of foreign language can harm the native culture and can alienate people from their indigenous culture. Language acts as a carrier of culture and culture carries orature and literature, but forced and imposed colonial language stopped orature (oral literature), in Kenyan language. Ngugi is greatly influenced by Frantz Fanon. Fanon believed that language has the power for mental decolonisation of people. In Black Skins, White Masks Fanon emphasis on his belief ‘to use a language is to assume a culture’ . He says, To speak a language is to take on a world, a culture. 
Ngugi believes that native language as Gikuyu plays an important role in the anti-imperialiststruggles. Gikuyu is a Kenyan language and an African language, is part and parcel of Kenyan and African people. In order to show his commitment towards his ethnic group Kikuyu he changed his Christian name James Ngugi to Ngugi wa Thiong’o. His denial of  colonial culture and language shows his staunch revolutionary figure against the forced culture and language. Ngugi emphasises on the idea that searching linguistic satisfaction through  foreign language is more like ‘linguicide’ which leads to the extinction of native language because of hegemonic language. According to Ngugi, “It is like separating the mind from the body so that they are occupying two unrelated linguistic spheres in the same person. On a larger social scale it is like producing a society of bodiless heads and headless bodies”
Ngugi wa Thiong'o believes that literature and politics are inextricably linked with each other because both are about "living men, actual men and women and children breathing, eating, crying, laughing, creating, dying, flowering men in history of whicl they are the products and the maker."
Therefore, he chose as the subject of his writings single events in the history of Kenya that has affected its people the most, namely, Mau Mau. Ngugi believes, together with many other African writers, that the primary aim of literature is not , merely to entertain but also to persuade. Ngugi, therefore, does not confine himself to mere chronicling of factual details of historical events, but he also adopts a position on them. In his own words:
What is important... is the attitude and the world view Embodied in (the Writer's) work arid with which he has persuaded us To identify vis-a-vis the historical drama his community is undergoing.
(Writers in Politics, p. 75)
While tracking the origin of the colonial process in capturing the economic resources of Kenya, particularly the illegal misappropriation of its fertile land - white highlands, as these came to be called - Ngugi does not overlook another important fact:
Cultural bomb'. Culture for Ngugi includes the sum total of all the intellectual,moral. ideological forces that give the social relations of production - what we call society - a unique character, a distinctive mark, a certain identity in a particular historical  phase .Culture, therefore, includes for Ngugi wa Thiong'o, the education system, the legal system, the religious system, language, literature, forms of dances and songs. Of these the two most significant instruments of cultural imperialism were the church and western system of education, both of which subserved the interests of colonialism.It is because of this that these two underlie the themes of almost all his creative writing including A Grain of Wheat wherein he exposed the collaborative role of Christianity most forcefully through the  character of Kihika, a revolutionary in the struggle for national freedom.
The other major component of the British colonial cultural bomb in Kenya has been education - the western system of education. Once again. tlhe western system of education which, like Christianity, had been first introduced by the missionaries as a part of the church activities to lure and beguile the gullible, had the same twin objectives of disrupting the traditional way of life in Kenya and to create a class of obedient Kenyans who, mouthing cliches and phrases from English language, expressed their allegiance openly to the power of colonialism. No wonder that this class received a big patronage from the colonial administration through nominations as village chiefs and employment in the home guards system, both of which played the negative role of collaborating with saboteurs during the height of Emergency between 1952 and 1957. Karanja in A Grain of Wheat is Ngugi's most powerful portrayal of such collaborators. 
In fact, this class of comprador bourgeoisie became the subject of Ngugi's Petals of Blood. Devil on the Cross and Matiguri wherein lie has shown this class to be essentially parasitic class with a wish for permanent identification with the cultures of imperialist bourgeoisie. The members of this parasitic class are the ones who promote prostitution, alcolholism and gambling by setting up massage parlours, beer-bars and casinos in the name of encouraging tourism and effecting 'development' of Kenya, particularly the rural areas. 
Ngugi, however, is not satisfied by mere portrayal of the socio-political situation in Kenya during and after the national struggle for independence. He suggests this in a book titled 'Decolonizing the Mind'. By this he means a kind of 'dialectal negation of the colonial process', dismantling, as it were, the various psychological structures that had been in the minds of men as a result of sustained colonial propaganda. covert as well as overt, during the period of colonization. In his book 'Writers in Politics', he suggests to the writers and intellectuals the task of 'going back to the roots' with the aim of restoring tthe African personality to its true creative potentials in history, so as to enhance the quality of life. He exhorts teachers and educational institutions to emphasizeAfrican languages and literatures while pleading with African writers to write in their own languages rather than in European languages.
Ngugi advocated the use of African languages as the vehicle for the writings by Africans. For many years, he observed, members of the petty bourgeois class comprising students. teachers, journalists and bureaucrats have continued to compose what Ngugi calls 'Afro-European literature' in the languages of Europe, for a readership that also came from the same class. It meant that the moment of truth for Ngugi had arrived. He had to link up his struggle through creative literature with the struggle of the Kenyan masses - now pitted against the comprador bourgeoisie that had usurped power in Kenya and was clinging to it. Thus in a statement prefixed to Decoionizirrg the Mind, Ngugi declared that -
This book. Decoionizing the Mirzd, is my farewell to English as a vehicle for any of my writings. From now on it is Gikuyu and Kiswahili as the way. (Preface, p. xiv)
Language has become one of the most vulnerable topic of Africa. For this a lot of philosophies have already given these ideas, among them two most considerable are Ngugi and Chinua Achebe. Both of them realized that the language has
become a matter of contention for the future of African culture, tradition and moreover society. If we talk about Achebe who wrote one of the best novel on African culture. Things fall apart, though he wrote this novel in English this should
not be taken that he preferred English over his native language but because he wanted his novel to reach in every single corner of the world so that everyone be familiar to the tradition and culture of Africans and above are the
sufferings that they have to face. So, it was not easy for Achebe to forget or marginalize his mother language. English being the international language; so he had not any other choice rather than choosing this language. In “Things fall apart” Achebe allowed others to understand native culture. He not only wants to portray a good image of the these poor people but to uplift and to stand beside the culture of Europeans, though there are some rudimentary faults in the culture of Africa as shown by Author in the novel but some well-educated and intellectual members are doing their best to make every possible change in the customs and make it advanced modern and good for its people in this way the main central issue that Achebe is portraying is that colonialism is not the only solution to advance their culture. If they think and get aware of their pros and cons they can also become one of the best culture the only thing that lack is lack of knowledge.
“Is it right that a man should abandon
his mother tongue for someone else’s?
It too looks like a dreadful betrayal and 
produces a guilty feeling.”
(Achebe, African writer 1962)
If we talk about Ngugi’s perspective he openly criticize Achebe for not using English language as a medium to make his novel more accessible in his opinion Achebe should use native language to make his work accessible to the lower class people or working class people of the society. Even though it was novel to uplift and portray African native culture but by using English as a medium of communication Achebe has not completely justified to the natives of Africa. On the other hand, Ngugiwas feeling that Achebe is motivating the intellectuals generation of the country that they should not devoid themselves from using English language but keep it side by hide and promote their own languages. On the other hand they should not allow English to become superiors for that the local people of the culture has to make a great effort to reach that language.
In my opinion Ngugi is the perfect preserver of culture because we should keep both languages side by side. Parents should educate their children to make them understand every language or particularly that language which would help themselves to explore more or become a part of global modernization but should not allow them to speak English but should make them understand their own culture in this way they are making their future generation not only educating their children but also making them realize who they are and what their history in and real identity is From the above discussion it has been clear that how colonial language is important over native African language to summarise this discussion, I would like to quote some lines by
“An African writer who chooses to write in colonial language-particularly English or French – will be able to reach a much larger audience both at home and abroad and will not be prevented from articulating mature ideas that the church, state or school finds offensive. As a consequence, what he writes will be for more representative of the intellectual climate of his time and place than anything written in local language for a smaller, younger and less heterogeneous audience”
(Achebe 1965:27-30)
Now the question that arises here is, why has the colonialism been the central factors of African writings? To answer this question we have to look back in history of Africa that reflects the rules imposed by Europeans over the continent has made a trauma in writers of the age hence the only aim for generating the African literature is to restore its history with dignity that is the reason why Achebe reveals his feelings in this quotation.
“I feel that English language will be able to carry the weight of my African experience but it will have to be a new English still in full communion with its ancestral home but altered to suit its new African surroundings.”
(African writer, 1962)
Africans are emphasizing on language because they not only want to preserve these history but also want to portray these culture to the world. History shows that Africans have been suffering from ages it is not only their language on the bases of which they face discriminated but color their physical features also because of their skin texture, they were not considered asa human beings but less than animals after so many years of slavery they are considered as equal to white skin people. Even though the world is focusing on Modernization and globalization; they are not treated well that is the reason that rise after being independent they are not liberal from mind somewhere at some corner of mind they feel alienated so they keep on struggling for their identity among other genes.
Let us focus on the language and its feature. Basically, language plays a vital role in two aspects
1. It is a mode of communication
2. It is a carrier of culture
In “Decolonizing the mind” Ngugi talks about the use of language in a post-colonial country and criticizes European languages because according to him African rill only can free their culture and heritage if they stop following western culture because west has a control over their culture and heritage according to Ngugi they can only free themselves from the clutches of westerns by using their native language over western. In this section he describes that how
alienation from one’s own culture would leads to the hatred for it. So, decolonizing the mind is Ngugi’s affective attempt to let free the minds of Natives to think what is right and what is wrong. Ngugi approaches Marxist perspective further Ngugi gave example of a child that how language is imposed on a child so that he can do good in studies but the society on parents are not aware with the fact that adopting colonizers language is the first step to adopt their culture and their culture and their native will become dominated indirectly in the beginning and directly later.
Language also serves as an important factor in assimilation process. Language has been used as an important tool in postcolonial studies. It has been a site of colonization and decolonization. The colonizer continuously tries to kill the native culture by destroyi
